The aim of this project is to create a etch-a-sketch game, with a UI which can beused in a web-browser.

Skills i will need to demonstrate in this project will include basic knowledge of javascript, HTML and CSS. I will have to use DOM operations as the user shouldbe able to choose grid size and some eventhandlers to be able to "draw" in the  grid.
